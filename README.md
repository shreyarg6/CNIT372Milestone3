# CNIT372Milestone3
CNIT 372 Group 5. The purpose of this project is to analyze Youtube usage and get insights from user information and interactions. This will help us to address interests and questions related to video popularity, user/viewer demographics, user search patterns, and community engagement.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION (MILESTONE 1)

Data we Plan to Use:
- User information
- User Interactions
- Search/Watch History

Insights Derived from Data:
- Users’ patterns
- Their interactions with videos
- Data related to their search and watch history
- Their overall interests

Significance/Importance of Listed Insights:
- A users’ personal information like their name, age, location, time of day, etc. and history can give insight into the users’ interests. As users’ we would be able to understand how or why certain videos get recommended to us. We would be able to continue seeing what we wanted. We would be able to analyze personal habits and continue to use our time in an efficient manner. 
Relationship among tables
- The UserInfo table stores the user’s information and is related to both the UserInteractions and UserHistory tables. The UserInfo table would have its PK (UserID)  which would serve as the FK in the other tables.

QUESTIONS LIST (MILESTONE 2)
1. Which type of video has the most number of views?
2. Which type of video is most popular in each age range based on likes? (ex). 13-17)
to the time of day?
3. Which type of video has the highest engagement (comments + likes) and how does this correlate with the age of the viewer?
4. Which types of videos have the highest average duration of time watched, and how does this correlate with the length of the video?
5. How will I be able to customize my homepage to show content that interests me the most?
6. Is there a pattern in video titles or descriptions that correlates with increased viewer engagement (likes and comments)
7. Which video categories have the most interactive communities, in terms of likes, comments, and subscriptions?
8. What types of videos get more comments on their videos?
9. What type of videos are blocked and not allowed in some organizations?
10. What speed are the videos played at (playback speed)?

CONTRIBUTION

All: All members put in equal efforts towards Milestone 3. There was consistent communication on the internal deadlines and what needed to be done. All members virtually met to discuss the Milestone 3 goals to complete our GitHub repository.

Shreya Guddeti: Created the GitHub repository and created the QuestionSolutions, YoutubeData, and ReadMe files. Organized and added the project description and question list to the readme file. Created the initial coding solutions to questions 1 and 3.

Rishika Thorat: Helped to process the CSV files found within the Kraggle Youtube Statistics folder. Created the tables within the YoutubeData file, and copied the data from the CSV files into 2 of the created tables. Created the coding solutions to Questions 2 and 7. Updated the solution to Question 1 so that it matched the data in YoutubeData and ran correctly. 

Kush Patel: Helped to process the CSV files found within the Kraggle Youtube Statistics folder. Created the coding solution to Question 8. Updated the solution to Question 3 so that it matched the data in YoutubeData and ran correctly.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION (MILESTONE 1)

Data we Plan to Use:
- User information
- User Interactions
- Search History
- Watch History

Insights Derived from Data:
- Users’ patterns
- Their interactions with videos
- Data related to their search and watch history
- Their overall interests

Significance/Importance of Listed Insights:
- A users’ personal information like their name, age, location, time of day, etc. and history can give insight into the users’ interests. As users’ we would be able to understand how or why certain videos get recommended to us. We would be able to continue seeing what we wanted. We would be able to analyze personal habits and continue to use our time in an efficient manner. 
Relationship among tables
- The UserInfo table stores the user’s information and is related to both the UserInteractions and UserHistory tables. The UserInfo table would have its PK (UserID)  which would serve as the FK in the other tables.
